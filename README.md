# CO2_Emissions_Regression-Model
Fitted a linear regression model to CO2 emissions data in Canada based on factors such as brand, transmission type, fuel type, vehicle class, and a few other variables. Despite not being able to predict the emission with very high accuracy, the regression can show the significance of each feature in determining CO2 emissions. Serving as a guide to further research and policy-making
